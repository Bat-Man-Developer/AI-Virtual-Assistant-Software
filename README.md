To run C++ programs using Code::Blocks, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Code::Blocks: If you haven't already, download and install Code::Blocks IDE from the official website (https://www.codeblocks.org/). Make sure to choose the appropriate version for your operating system.

2. Create a new C++ project: Launch Code::Blocks and click on "Create a new project" or go to "File" > "New" > "Project". From the project types list, select "Console application" and click "Go".

3. Set project details: Choose "C++" as the project type and give your project a name. Select the location where you want to save your project and click "Next".

4. Select a compiler: Choose the compiler you want to use. Code::Blocks usually comes with GCC by default. Ensure that the selected compiler is compatible with your system and click "Finish".

5. Write your C++ code: Code::Blocks will create a basic C++ template for you. You can start writing your C++ code in the editor window.

6. Save your code: Go to "File" > "Save" to save your C++ code.

7. Build your project: To compile your C++ code, click on the "Build" menu and choose "Build" or press the F9 key. Code::Blocks will compile your code and display any errors or warnings in the "Build Log" window.

8. Run your program: If the compilation is successful, you can run your program by clicking on the "Run" menu and choosing "Run" or by pressing the F10 key. The output of your program will be displayed in the "Console" window.

That's it! You have successfully written and run a C++ program using Code::Blocks. You can modify your code, rebuild the project, and rerun it as needed.
